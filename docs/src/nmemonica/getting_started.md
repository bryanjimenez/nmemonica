# Getting Started

After loading the application for the first time and reading the [guidelines](./settings/guidelines.md) you will likely want to add study material (Phrases, Vocabulary and Kanji). Most parts of the app depend on user created study material with the exception of the Kana/Hiragana/Katakana game. 

Study material (UGC[^UGC]) can be imported or entered directly. 

### Entering Data
To begin entering data click the hamburger menu ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/primer/octicons/main/icons/three-bars-16.svg "Menu Button") and then the [Edit](./edit.md) icon. This will navigate you to the data entry/edit page where the Kanji, Vocabulary and Phrases are stored (in CSV[^CSV] format).
### Importing Data
See the **Connection** action in the [Action Menu](./actions.md#connection) section.
