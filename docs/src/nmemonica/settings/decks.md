# Kanji, Vocabulary and Phrases Settings

Different available filtering, sorting, and other options can be set from here. Each deck has it's own independent settings section.


## Filter by
On the left side each deck's setting section has a list of Tags or Groups that the deck can be filtered by. Selecting no items will cancel any filtering and all terms will be displayed. Making a selection of Tags or Groups will filter and narrow the deck to only contain those within the selection.


## Sort by
On the top right side there is a list of available sorting options.  

- Randomized
- Alphabetic (Japanese)
- Difficulty (adjust w/ slider)
- Viewed Date (oldest terms first)
- Recall Interval
