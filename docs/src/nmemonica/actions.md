Users can share their UGC[^UGC] or backup to another device by linking the two devices. Selecting the **Connection** action and exchanging QR Codes with a peer (the receiving user) will temporarily link the devices. Once devices are linked UGC[^UGC] can be exchanged via a secure peer-to-peer WebRTC[^WebRTC] connection.
